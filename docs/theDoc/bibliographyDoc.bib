abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a novel system-level model order reduction scheme for flexible multibody simulation, namely the system-level affine projection (SLAP). Contrary to existing system-level model order reduction approaches for multibody systems simulation, this methodology allows to obtain a constant reduced order basis which can be obtained in a noninvasive fashion with respect to the original flexible multibody model. It is shown that this scheme enables an automatic joint constraint elimination which can be obtained at low computational cost through exploitation of the component level modes typically employed in flexible multibody simulation. The equations of motion are derived such that the computational cost of the resulting SLAP model is independent of the original model size. This approach results in a set of ordinary differential equations with a constant mass matrix and nonlinear internal forces. This structure makes the resulting model suitable for a range of estimation, control, and design applications. The proposed approach is validated numerically on a flexible four-bar mechanism and shows good accuracy for a very low-order SLAP model.},

abstract = "Due to the increase in speed and lightweight construction, modern robots vibrate significantly during motion. Thus, accurate mechanical modeling and detailed controller behavior is essential for accurate path planning and control design of robots. For the suppression of undesired vibrations detailed models are used to develop robust controllers. Least square identification methods require deep insight in the analytical equations and thus are not very suitable for identification of different highly nonlinear robot models. Recently, we presented our genetic parameter identification in Brussels, Ludwig and Gerstmayr (2011). It minimizes the error of measured and simulated quantities. Highly efficient models in the multibody system tool HOTINT lead to short computational times for various simulations with different parameters. The simulation models can easily be assembled by engineers without a detailed knowledge of the underlying multibody system. As drawback of genetic optimization, many sub-minima were detected. Many simulations were required for the determination of the global minimum. Our current approach was to extend our previous algorithm. Measured and simulated quantities are transformed into the frequency domain. In contrast to previous work, Ludwig and Gerstmayr (2013), amplitude spectra of measured and simulated quantities are smoothed prior to the L2-norm computation. The presented method is tested using small scale test problems as well as real robots. Smoothing in the frequency domain leads to a smaller number of simulations needed for obtaining higher accuracy. It turns out that the presented algorithm is more accurate and precise than a standard algorithm and reduces the computational cost."

In the past years, more than 10 researchers have contributed to certain parts of HOTINT, such as solver, graphical user interface, element library, joint library, finite element functionality and port blocks. Currently, a script-language based version of HOTINT is freely available for download, intended for research, education and industrial applications. The main features of the current available version include objects like point mass, rigid bodies, complex point-based joints, classical mechanical joints, flexible (nonlinear) beams, port-blocks for mechatronics applications and many other features such as loads, sensors and graphical objects. HOTINT includes a 3D graphical visualization showing the results immediately during simulation, which helps to reduce modelling errors. In the present paper, we show the current state and the structure of the code. Examples should demonstrate the easiness of use of HOTINT.}",

abstract = "In finite element methods that are based on position and slope coordinates, a representation of axial and bending deformation by means of an elastic line approach has become popular. Such beam and plate formulations based on the so-called absolute nodal coordinate formulation have not yet been verified sufficiently enough with respect to analytical results or classical nonlinear rod theories. Examining the existing planar absolute nodal coordinate element, which uses a curvature proportional bending strain expression, it turns out that the deformation does not fully agree with the solution of the geometrically exact theory and, even more serious, the normal force is incorrect. A correction based on the classical ideas of the extensible elastica and geometrically exact theories is applied and a consistent strain energy and bending moment relations are derived. The strain energy of the solid finite element formulation of the absolute nodal coordinate beam is based on the St. Venant–Kirchhoff material: therefore, the strain energy is derived for the latter case and compared to classical nonlinear rod theories. The error in the original absolute nodal coordinate formulation is documented by numerical examples. The numerical example of a large deformation cantilever beam shows that the normal force is incorrect when using the previous approach, while a perfect agreement between the absolute nodal coordinate formulation and the extensible elastica can be gained when applying the proposed modifications. The numerical examples show a very good agreement of reference analytical and numerical solutions with the solutions of the proposed beam formulation for the case of large deformation pre-curved static and dynamic problems, including buckling and eigenvalue analysis. The resulting beam formulation does not employ rotational degrees of freedom and therefore has advantages compared to classical beam elements regarding energy-momentum conservation."
