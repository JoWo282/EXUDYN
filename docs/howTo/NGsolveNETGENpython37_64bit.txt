#NGsolve:
- follow link: https://ngsolve.org/downloads
- Install the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Redistributables: https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x64.exe
- Download the Netgen/NGSolve msi - installer of the latest release: https://github.com/NGSolve/ngsolve/releases

Recommended:
- use installation path: C:\ProgramData\ngsolve
- if you use Python 3.6 and Python 3.7 in parallel, do not add recommended PATH variables, 
  but set them manually with EXUDYN_git\tools\python37\workingReleaseSetPython3.7_64bit.bat (only in developer version)

Change system paths:
- go to system environment (Start->(Search)-> Environment Variables), needs administrator rights
- your system path should include (AnacondaPath is the path where you installed anaconda):
    AnacondaPath
    AnacondaPath\Library\bin
    AnacondaPath\Library\usr\bin
    AnacondaPath\Librarymingw-w64\bin
    AnacondaPath\Scripts
- alternatively copy/paste using modify/modify text: 
    C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3_64b37;C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3_64b37\Library\mingw-w64\bin;C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3_64b37\Library\usr\bin;C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3_64b37\Library\bin;C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3_64b37\Scripts;

Change local user paths:
- go to environment variables of local user (not administrator) and add if it does not exist:
variable PYTHONPATH: AnacondaPath;[NGsolve-install-dir]\lib\site-packages
variable PYTHONHOME: AnacondaPath

ADD NGsolve manually:
import sys
sys.path.append('C:/ProgramData/ngsolve/lib/site-packages')

using NGsolve/NETGEN in Spyder:
- without graphics, everything should work fine
- if you would like to visualize meshes, etc.: you must set
  ->preferences->Run->Execute in an external system terminal (needs Spyder restart)
