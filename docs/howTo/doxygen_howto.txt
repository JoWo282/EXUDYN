#install for EXUDYN:
download doxygen:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/files/snapshots/

download graphviz:
http://www.graphviz.org/download/

add doxygen to system path (start->system environment variables), ADD:
C:\Program Files\doxygen\bin

add graphviz to system path (start->system environment variables), ADD:
C:\Program Files\Graphviz2.44.1\bin

now editing the Doxyfile.txt in the docs/doxygen folder allows you to setup the
html build for doxygen. Since some time, latex fails, probably because of some
comments which are not compatible with doxygen and some log messages would
need to be parsed.

latex:
 - be careful with latex commands with inline formulas: \f$ x^2 \f$ and display formulas_ \f[ y+x=2 \f]
 - 64-bit ghostscript installation: copy gswin64c.exe to gswin32c.exe in ghostscript directory
 - add ghostscript bin path to environment variables
 - check according flags in doxygen; graphs might be slow (but parallelized on good CPUs)
 - set "USE_MATHJAX = NO" in case of \newcommand definitions for latex commands - will not be recognized
