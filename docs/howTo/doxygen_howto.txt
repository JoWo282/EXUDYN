latex:
 - be careful with latex commands with inline formulas: \f$ x^2 \f$ and display formulas_ \f[ y+x=2 \f]
 - 64-bit ghostscript installation: copy gswin64c.exe to gswin32c.exe in ghostscript directory
 - add ghostscript bin path to environment variables
 - check according flags in doxygen; graphs might be slow (but parallelized on good CPUs)
 - set "USE_MATHJAX = NO" in case of \newcommand definitions for latex commands - will not be recognized
