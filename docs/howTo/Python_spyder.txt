This document gives some help regarding Python and Spyder
=========================================================

COMPATIBILITY:
1a) Currently tested versions: 
	- Spyder:3.2.8
	- Python: 3.6.5 32bits, Qt 5.9.4, PyQt 5.9.2 on Windows
	- Python 3.6.5 64bits, in VS2017; (last) Anaconda 5.2.0 with Python 3.6: Anaconda3-5.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe, see link: 
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54801513/how-can-i-download-anaconda-for-python-3-6
		https://repo.continuum.io/archive/
1b) Python versions of Exudyn/VS2017 (3.6) and Spyder must be same up to subversion: 3.6.x

1c) Python 32/64 bit compatibility: must be same in Exudyn/VS2017 and in Spyder: 32 bits !!!

1c) VS2017 32/64 bit: when switching, make sure that:
	- add /bigobj to additional compiler options, as pybind11 generates many sections
	- 64bit enabled in cppscr configuration
	- in cppsrc: C/C++: change python includes to 64bit path:
		$(SolutionDir)\src;$(SolutionDir)\include\lest;$(SolutionDir)\include\glfw;$(SolutionDir)\include\glfw\deps;$(SolutionDir)\include\pybind11;C:\Program Files %28x86%29\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python36_64\include;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)
	- in cppsrc: linker:
		choose libs/libs64 path for glfw3.lib (which can be just downloaded)
		choose 64bit python libs
		==> $(SolutionDir)\libs\libs64;C:\Program Files %28x86%29\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python36_64\libs;%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)
	- in cppsrc: copy all other settings from 32bit
	- in pythonDev: choose python environment with 64bit (same version, e.g. python 3.6)


RUNNING Exudyn in SPYDER:

2a) running Exudyn in Spyder may cause problems with the GLFW visualization, which does not always close
	the GLFW window appropriatly; runing Exudyn a second time, causes a crash
    ==> WORKAROUND:
	1) restart kernel in current console by mouse click on "x" (closing button)
	2) preferences->Run: Set "Execute in an external system terminal" ==> in this way multiple runs are possible with graphics
