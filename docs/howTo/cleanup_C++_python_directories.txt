this document shows, how to cleanup C++ and python directories

delete:
- .vs files
- doxygen/latex and html directories
- Release directory (bin; obj/bin)
- Debug directory (bin; obj/bin)
- pythonDev/coordinatesSolution.txt and other output files (usually >10MB)
- __pycache__ directories (in pythonDev and subfolders)
- docs: .log, .aux, .toc, etc.

whole repository (without .git) should have a size of approx. 50MB in the end (2019-11-22: 45,6MB, 730 files and 92 folders)
